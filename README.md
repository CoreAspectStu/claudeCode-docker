## Prerequisites

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Complete these steps BEFORE using claude-docker:

### 1. Claude Code Authentication (Required)
You must authenticate Claude Code on your host system first:
```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Run and complete authentication
claude

# Verify authentication files exist
ls ~/.claude.json ~/.claude/
```

üìñ **Full Claude Code Setup Guide**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

### 2. Docker Installation (Required)
- **Docker Desktop**: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Ensure Docker daemon is running before proceeding

### 3. Git Configuration (Required)
Git configuration is automatically loaded from your host system during Docker build:
- Make sure you have configured git on your host system first:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```
- **Important**: Claude Docker will commit to your current branch - make sure you're on the correct branch before starting

### 4. SSH Keys for Git Push (Optional - for push/pull operations)
Claude Docker uses dedicated SSH keys (separate from your main SSH keys for security):

**Setup SSH keys:**
```bash
# 1. Create directory for Claude Docker SSH keys
mkdir -p ~/.claude-docker/ssh

# 2. Generate SSH key for Claude Docker
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa -N ''

# 3. Add public key to GitHub
cat ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copy output and add to: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key

# 4. Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com -i ~/.claude-docker/ssh/id_rsa
```

**Why separate SSH keys?**
- ‚úÖ **Security Isolation**: Claude can't access or modify your personal SSH keys, config, or known_hosts
- ‚úÖ **SSH State Persistence**: The SSH directory is mounted (not copied) so that SSH state files like `known_hosts` persist between sessions - without this, you'd get host key verification prompts every time
- ‚úÖ **Easy Revocation**: Delete `~/.claude-docker/ssh/` to instantly revoke Claude's git access
- ‚úÖ **Clean Audit Trail**: All Claude SSH activity is isolated and easily traceable

**Technical Note**: We mount the SSH directory rather than copying keys because SSH operations modify several files (`known_hosts`, connection state) that must persist between container sessions for a smooth user experience.

### 5. Twilio Account (Optional - for SMS notifications)
If you want SMS notifications when tasks complete:
- Create free trial account: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account
- Get your Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console
- Get a phone number for sending SMS

### Why Pre-authentication?
The Docker container needs your existing Claude authentication to function. This approach:
- ‚úÖ Uses your existing Claude subscription/API access
- ‚úÖ Maintains secure credential handling
- ‚úÖ Enables persistent authentication across container restarts

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/VishalJ99/claude-docker.git
cd claude-docker

# 2. Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your API keys (see below)

# 3. Install
./scripts/install.sh

# 4. Run from any project
cd ~/your-project
claude-docker

# Optional: Set up SSH keys for git push (see Prerequisites section)
# The script will show setup instructions if keys are missing
```

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# SMS notifications (highly recommended!)
# Perfect for long-running tasks - step away and get notified when done
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid  
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
TWILIO_TO_NUMBER=+0987654321

# Optional - Custom conda paths
CONDA_PREFIX=/path/to/your/conda
CONDA_EXTRA_DIRS="/path/to/envs /path/to/pkgs"

# Optional - System packages
SYSTEM_PACKAGES="libopenslide0 libgdal-dev"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Credentials are baked into the Docker image. Keep your image secure!

## Usage Patterns

### Persistent History & Crash Recovery
Claude Docker automatically preserves conversation history and resumes from interruptions:

- **History Location**: `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/` on your host machine
- **Automatic Resume**: Uses `--continue` flag to resume conversations after crashes
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: History persists between Docker container restarts
- **Crash Recovery**: If Claude crashes or gets interrupted, simply restart - it will continue where it left off

### One-Time Setup Per Project
For the best experience, run `claude-docker` once per project and leave it running:

1. **Start Claude Docker:**
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   claude-docker
   ```

2. **Detach from the session (keep it running):**
   - **Mac/Linux**: `Ctrl + P`, then `Ctrl + Q`
   - Hold Control key, press P, then Q while still holding Control
   - Container keeps running in background

3. **Reattach when needed:**
   ```bash
   docker ps                           # Find your container ID
   docker attach claude-docker-session # Reattach to the session
   ```

4. **Stop when done with project:**
   ```bash
   docker stop claude-docker-session
   ```


## Features

### ü§ñ Full Autonomy
- Claude runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for complete access
- Can read, write, execute, and modify any files in your project
- No permission prompts or restrictions

### üîå Modular MCP Server Support
- Easy installation of any MCP server through `mcp-servers.txt`
- Automatic environment variable handling for MCP servers requiring API keys
- Pre-configured popular servers (Twilio, GitHub, filesystem, browser automation)
- See [MCP_SERVERS.md](MCP_SERVERS.md) for full setup guide

### üì± SMS Notifications  
- Automatic SMS via Twilio when Claude completes tasks
- Configurable via MCP integration
- Optional - works without if Twilio not configured

### üêç Conda Integration
- Has access to your conda envs so do not need to add build instructions to the Dockerfile
- Supports custom conda installation directories (ideal for academic/lab environments where home is quota'd)


### üîë Authentication Persistence
- Login once, use forever - authentication tokens persist across sessions
- Automatic UID/GID mapping ensures perfect file permissions between host and container

### üìù Task Execution Logging  
- Prompt engineered to generate `task_log.md` documenting agent's execution process
- Stores assumptions, insights, and challenges encountered
- Acts as a simple summary to quickly understand what the agent accomplished

### üê≥ Clean Environment
- Each session runs in fresh Docker container
- Only current working directory mounted (along with conda directories specified in `.env`).

## How It Works

1. **Wrapper Script**: `claude-docker.sh` handles container lifecycle
2. **Auto-Setup**: Creates `.claude` directory with proper config on first run
3. **MCP Integration**: Twilio MCP server runs alongside Claude Code
4. **Project Mounting**: Your project directory mounts to `/workspace`
5. **Clean Exit**: Container removes itself when Claude session ends


## Configuration

During build, the `.env` file from the claude-docker directory is baked into the image:
- Credentials are embedded at `/app/.env` inside the container
- No need to manage .env files in each project
- The image contains everything needed to run

The setup creates `~/.claude-docker/` in your home directory with:
- `claude-home/` - Persistent Claude authentication and settings
- `config/` - MCP server configuration

### CLAUDE.md Configuration

The `CLAUDE.md` file controls Claude's behavior and is managed as follows:

1. **First Run**: If no CLAUDE.md exists at `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/CLAUDE.md`, the template from this repository is copied there
2. **Subsequent Runs**: The existing CLAUDE.md at `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/CLAUDE.md` is used
3. **Customization**: Edit `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/CLAUDE.md` to customize Claude's behavior across all projects
4. **Reset to Template**: Delete `~/.claude-docker/claude-home/CLAUDE.md` and restart to get the latest template

Each project gets:
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings with MCP
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions (if you create one)

### Rebuilding the Image

The Docker image is built only once when you first run `claude-docker`. To force a rebuild:

```bash
# Remove the existing image
docker rmi claude-docker:latest

# Next run of claude-docker will rebuild
claude-docker
```

Rebuild when you:
- Update your .env file with new credentials
- Update the Claude Docker repository

### Conda Configuration

For custom conda installations (common in academic/lab environments), add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Main conda installation
CONDA_PREFIX=/vol/lab/username/miniconda3

# Additional conda directories (space-separated)
CONDA_EXTRA_DIRS="/vol/lab/username/.conda/envs /vol/lab/username/conda_envs /vol/lab/username/.conda/pkgs /vol/lab/username/conda_pkgs"
```

**How it works:**
- `CONDA_PREFIX`: Mounts your conda installation to the same path in container
- `CONDA_EXTRA_DIRS`: Mounts additional directories and automatically configures conda

**Automatic Detection:**
- Paths containing `*env*` ‚Üí Added to `CONDA_ENVS_DIRS` (conda environment search)
- Paths containing `*pkg*` ‚Üí Added to `CONDA_PKGS_DIRS` (package cache search)

**Result:** All your conda environments and packages work exactly as they do on your host system.

### System Package Installation

For scientific computing packages that require system libraries, add them to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Install OpenSlide for medical imaging
SYSTEM_PACKAGES="libopenslide0"

# Install multiple packages (space-separated)
SYSTEM_PACKAGES="libopenslide0 libgdal-dev libproj-dev libopencv-dev"
```

**Note:** Adding system packages requires rebuilding the Docker image (`docker rmi claude-docker:latest`).
## How This Differs from Anthropic's DevContainer

We provide a different approach than [Anthropic's official .devcontainer](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer), optimized for autonomous task execution:


### Feature Comparison

| Feature | claude-docker | Anthropic's DevContainer |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| **IDE Support** | Any editor/IDE | VSCode-specific |
| **Authentication** | Once per machine, persists forever | Per-devcontainer setup |
| **Conda Environments** | Direct access to all host envs | Manual setup in Dockerfile |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Optimized CLAUDE.md for tasks | Standard behavior |
| **Network Access** | Full access (firewall coming soon) | Configurable firewall |
| **SMS Notifications** | Built-in Twilio MCP | Not available |
| **Permissions** | Auto (--dangerously-skip-permissions) | Auto (--dangerously-skip-permissions) |


**Note**: Network firewall functionality similar to Anthropic's implementation is our next planned feature.

## Next Steps

**Phase 2 - Security Enhancements:**
- Network firewall to whitelist specific domains (similar to Anthropic's DevContainer)
- Shell history persistence between sessions
- Additional security features
